This is a set of files I created in p5js - downloaded then uploaded to github. 
Not sure if there is an easier way. to connect directly from p5js editor to github. 
You can view this on https://funkstop.github.io/TimeCircles

Future iterations will give adjustable variables for hours, minutes, seconds, etc
